## Present
    - BB, WM, BP(Skype), SM

## Discussion

- Finalizing project:
  Aim to present at the 13.12
  Having a doc or a tool to help set everything up on openwhisk/aws

- Progress
    - Bill: bluemix created account tried using a action, was able to run basic js action. Wasn't able to run docker action yet
    - William: aws found some tutorial how to run docker container, but a bit hacky and maybe slow (losing advantage of serverless)
    - Leo: build docker container with wasmer runtime and mounted wasm file, was able to run it.  
           Found another approach using node.js, so docker would not be needed.
  
## Next steps

- Team to look into possibility using on node.js runing wasm file in javascript on the different enviroments
    -Fall back to docker if it fails
    -Docker container is quite large, investigate why? And include entrypoint so you don't need to include it in the docker run command.
    -AWS try layered approach 
- SM, SP What is required for the final presentation? Report, Demo, etc...
