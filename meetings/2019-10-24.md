# Notes on meeting - 2019-10-24

## Present

- BP, WM, SM
- BB gave apologies

## Discussion

### Status update

- BP gave update on wasmtime activities
    - managed to get toolchain up and running
    - compiled hello world in C
    - golang support in wasmtime is poor
        - got blocked on this issue
    - rust and c appear to be well supported
- WM gave update on lucet activities
    - Was able to get basic C program working with lucet
    - documented in github repo
    - looking into getting golang stuff up and running
- BB managed to get some wasmer examples up and running
    - is documented in repo, but needs a bit more detail

### Presentation

- Draft presentation was given
    - Presentation was good overall
    - Some feedback:
        - Need to bring serverless back in to the narrative in the final slides
        - Need to ensure that message that WASM started out as a browser technology but may have server side potential (with a couple of reasons why) is made clear
    - Some compare and constrast of the different solutions would be good
        - For me, it was not clear that lucetc can compile wasm to native executable
            - This is an interesting dimension and should also be brought into the performance comparison

### Next steps
- BP to look into how wasmer supports compiling golang to wasm executable
- BP, WM, BB to look into basic C system performance testing (matrix mult, prime searching, sorting) and run in this enviroment to obtain basic comparison
    - Should include lucetc and lucetc-wasi
- WM to progress with checking out support for golang in lucet
- All to amend slides for presentation next week
