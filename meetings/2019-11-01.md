# Notes on meeting - 2019-11-1

## Present

- BP, WM, SM, BB, SP

## Discussion

### Status update
- BP gave update on platform comparioson:
  - Wasmer got most momentun, most activity
- WM gave update on lucet activities and benchmarks
    - lucet process: Converting c into native code, which still need to be run with the lucet runtime -> why?
    - run benchmarks for wasm files
- I gave update to wasmer activities
    - Wasmer does not support go, but the provide extension to embed wasm files into other language
    - Wasmer uses wasicc / wasic++ : The Clang compiler to compile c/c++
    - Go supports wasm as compile target, but as BP noted the wasm files don't work with any tool chains
    - Run c benchmarks

### Benchmarks

- Made four benchmarks, all were written in c and compiled to a wasm file which was then used in the different toolchain:
    - Prime: checks wheter the largegst integeger is an prime number or not
      - Observation wasmer was the fastest and wasmtime the slowest
      - Runtime was almost same as native
    - Fibonacci:
        - Returns the n th fib number, did test with n = 42 and 52
        - Observed that lucet was fastest for n = 52 and both wasmer and lucet were significantly faster then wasmtime 
    - Matrix multiplication: multiply two 800x800 matrices
        - All were very fast beeing in the ms region, but lucet was 10times slower. SM noted could indicate that lucet might need longer start up time.
    - Bubble sort problems compiling, probably memory allocation problem try again.
- Remarks:
 - wasmtime was almost in all test the least performant toolchain, for decision we still need more benchmarks -> also do it in rust
 - Interesting results, there is community that might be intrested in a blog post. Will look into it in a later stage, with a complete image.
    

### Next steps
- modify matrix multiplication so it runs with random generated matrices
- fix bubble sort 
- test rust support
- how to import parameters into wasm
- understand lucet, why compile it into native code and then still use lucet runtime
- rust application that takes a string input and append it to a log file
