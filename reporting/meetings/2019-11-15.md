## Present

## Discussion

### Status update
- updates on json handling when running container
  - works now with single quotes
  - should now work
- updates on creating docker container that runs the wasm runtime
  - issues don't need to add wasm file to the docker container but for the first step it makes more sense
  - wasmer in docker not that simple because of the dependencies c and wasi-sdk
  - running wasmer build script but there are two issues
  - one is fixed and the other one is still open
  - try only using the local already running runtime
- updates on getting Openwhisk up and running
  - followed  tutorial of James Thomas
  - something wrong maybe with ip and old installations
  - leo also tried to install it manually
  - with docker it worked without Kubernetes
  - runs on one node but not that's not best practice
  - maybe make sense to run it on bluemix

### Next steps
- getting docker container running in Openwhisk
- investigate mechanism to pass params from openwhisk to runtime
  - maybe use cloud events
- start investigating how solution can be run on AWS inside lambda - prob using lambda layers
  - invoke another runtime to use wasmer
  - use free tier but sean will organize some free credit
- report
  - some overview, what has been done, achievements, github links
