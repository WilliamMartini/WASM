# Notes on meeting - 2019-11-8

## Present

- BP, WM, SM, BB

## Discussion

### Status update
- BP gave update on compiling Rust to WebAssembly
    - wasmtime has a runtime error when trying to write to files
    - wasmer has not implemented the write append function
    - we currently have a wasm program the parses a JSON string and saves it to file
    - fixed memory allocation in matrix multiplication 
- WM gave update on lucet activities and benchmarks
    - Looked at compiling Rust programs to wasm
    - Reran previous tests in Rust
    - Ran a new bubble sort
    - Lucet gives an error running the new matrix multiplication
- BB gave update to OpenWisk
    - Researched serverless and OpenWisk
    - Started the install process of OpenWisk

### Remarks
 - rust fib in lucet was 8 mins faster at n=52
 - wasmtime was eliminited 
 - Lucet 2 step runtime (needing .so file to run) lead us to favour wasmer
    

### Next steps
- Have OpenWisk up and running
- Investigate the resources required to run OpenWisk
- Create a docker container that contains the wasmer runtime and wasm application
- Run the docker container with OpenWisk
