# Notes on meeting - 2019-10-04

## Present
    - BB, WM, BP, SP, SM

## Discussion

- SM gave overview of project what is the purpose and what is to be achieved
    - with caveat that it is experimental so we need to be flexible in implementation
- Basic steps
    - Review server side WASM frameworks (wasmer, wasmtime, lucet)
        - https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer
        - https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime
        - https://github.com/fastly/lucet
    - Run through compile process for sample applications on each of these platforms
    - Run through compile process for basic golang based serverless function
        - function can take string as input which contains JSON format data, unmarshals it and stores it to log
    - Perform basic comparison of different platforms
        - ease of use, maturity of toolchain, size, momentum of community
    - Choose one as the basis for proceeding
    - Create docker container containing wasm runtime and wasm file with minimal serverless application
        - run locally
    - Run this on Openwhisk
    - Look into running this on AWS - use Lambda layers to add wasm runtime and wasm application
        - This can be triggered via serverless function
    - Add some glue mechanism which can take an input from the serverless platform and pass it on to the wasm binary
        - Perhaps using the CloudEvents event format
            - https://cloudevents.io/
    - Document process for building wasm binary which can be run on different serverless platforms
    - Look into issues associated with running WASM directly on serverless platforms

- BP asked about use of AWS resources
    - SM is still looking into this
- Team asked about what language platform is preferred; SM suggested golang and team was comfortable with that

## Next steps

- Team to look into the above three different environments
    - Each to investigate one of them
    - SM noted that these are still immature technologies, so there could be problems/issues working with the tools, lack of documentation etc
    - Report on progress at next meeting
- SM, SP to look into providing VMs for team for working on these technologies

## Next meeting

- 2019-10-11, 0930 CEST, skype/gotomeeting
